Simplified version of netcat. Should work with netcat server. It allows a user to get info from a server and send to the server with TCP or UDP connection.


if the -s option is used: the client binds to the ip_address on port 8080

Make the file by:
make snc


RUN BY:
./snc [-l] [-u] [-s source_ip_address] [hostname] port
